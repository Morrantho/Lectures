### Learning Objectives:

* Installation
* Connecting a DB to Node.
* CRUD with Mongoose.
* Associations + Validations.

### Discussion Questions:

* <details>
	<summary>Can we use Mongo without Mongoose? How?<summary>

	Yes. There are other Node modules that allow us to connect to a mongodb server other than Mongoose. In Python, py-mongo is a plugin that lets us do this same thing. Feel free to explore different plugins that will let you do this.
</details>

* <details>
	<summary>Can we do joins with Mongoose?</summary>

	Sort've. MongoDB is non-relational, but we can still store references to Object Id's, which means we can compare against other Object Id's in another collection.
</details>

* <details>
	<summary>How can we install Mongoose and connect it to a mongoDB database?</summary>

	First, we need to run <code>npm install mongoose --save</code> in our terminal. Then we need to require it and run <code>mongoose.connect()</code>. The last forward slash followed by a word is the database we are telling mongoDB to use.

	```javascript
		var mongoose = require('mongoose');
		mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/myDatabase');
	```
</details>

* <details>
	<summary>What is a Mongoose Schema and how do we create one using Mongoose?</summary>

	A schema in Mongoose is simply a collection in MongoDB. Once we create one, we will have full access / control of MongoDB CRUD methods via our Node server. Mongoose will create this collection in the database we chose using: <code>mongoose.connect();</code>

	```javascript

		// Give this collection name and age columns.

		let UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
			name: String,
			age: Number
		})

		// Name this collection "User"

		mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);

		// Retrieve our newly created collection, so we can manipulate it.

		let User = mongoose.model('User')

	```
</details>

* <details>
	<summary>Where would these Database Calls be placed in our Node app? What would that look like?<summary>

	These database calls would happen in our controllers, based on the CRUD action we intend to take:

	```javascript

		// Creating / Saving a new "User"

		app.post("/users/new",(req,res)=>{
			let user = new User(req.body);

			user.save((err)=>{
				if(err){
					res.status(400).json("Failed to save user");
				}else{
					res.redirect("/users");						
				}
			});
		});

	```
</details>

* <details>
	<summary>How many callbacks do you see in a single HTTP POST route for a Creation operation?</summary>

	There are usually two. The first one to indicate what we want to do upon a client visiting our route. The second is what we want to do when we've successfully or unsuccessfully saved / inserted the new document.
