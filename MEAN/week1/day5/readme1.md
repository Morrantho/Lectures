### Learning Objectives:
* MongoDB basics
* Mongo shell
* CRUD through the Mongo shell

### Discussion:
* Mongo is NoSQL. NoSQL stands for 'NOT ONLY SQL'.
* Compare documents, collections, and DBs with rows, tables, and Schemas.
* No joins!
* But you can still make your own foreign key relationships manually. We will do this with Mongoose.
* Many-to-many relationships = hard. Not Mongo's strength.
* Not a primary database, SQL is still king of relational data.
