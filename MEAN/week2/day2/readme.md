 	1. We hit a POST route. Ex: "/users/login"
 	2. Run our controller method for this route. Ex: UserController.login()
 	3. Validate their inputs and find out if they exist in our database.
 	4. If they exist in our database, compare the DB password hash with the POST data password.
 	5. If these inputs match, store the user's id in session. Ex: req.session.id = user._id;
 	6. Redirect them to a dashboard.

3. Validate their inputs and find out if they already exist in our database. If so, deny creation.
