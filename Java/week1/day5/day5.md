### Spring Fundamentals

* Static
* Dependency Injection
* Render data to Views
* Tag Libraries
* Session
* Request Params (These come from forms)
* Path Variables (These come from routes)
* Redirect

### Demo

Demonstrate rendering data to views, POST, c:out, session, request params, path variables and redirects. Make a form that creates a student, puts them in an ArrayList<Student> on POST, redirecting back to the same route. Store the most recently created Student in session. Then create a /students/id route to demonstrate path variables, showing each individual students info.
