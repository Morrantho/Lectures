### Python Fundamentals

### How can we debug our Python code?
<details>
    * Google your errors.
    * print your variables.
    * print your variable types.
    * Comment sections of your code.
    * Goto the line number and <code>.py</code> file the python interpreter tells us has an error.
    * Google your errors.
</details>

### How can we declare a function?

```python
def add(num,num2):
    #Function Body.
    return num+num2;
```

### How are lists, tuples and dictionaries different?
<details>
    <summary>Lists</summary>

    Lists are like arrays in that they store
    data or mutliple values as indices as opposed to key / value pairs.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Dictionaries</summary>

    Dictionaries use key / value pairs to map data or values, rather than indices / numbers.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Tuples</summary>

    Tuples operate similarly to a list, except once data has been entered into it, it cannot be changed. This gives us a more secure data structure and may help reduce or prevent errors.
