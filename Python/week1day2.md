### Python Fundamentals

### How can we debug our Python code?

* Google your errors.
* print your variables.
* print your variable types.
* Comment sections of your code.
* Goto the line number and .py file the python interpreter tells us has an error.
* Google your errors.

### How can we declare a function?

```python
def add(num,num2):
    #Function Body.
    return num+num2;
```

### How are lists, tuples and dictionaries different?

<details>
    <summary>Lists</summary>

    Lists are like arrays in that they store
    data or multiple values as indices as opposed to key / value pairs.

    <code>
        shoppingList = [];
        shoppingList.append("milk");
        shoppingList.append("bread");
        shoppingList.append("eggs");
    </code>

<details>
    <summary>Dictionaries</summary>

    Dictionaries use key / value pairs to map data or values, rather than indices / numbers.

    <code>
        customer = {
            "firstName":"John",
            "lastName":"Smith",
            "city":"McLean"
            "state":"VA"
            "address":"123 Bottleneck Dr."
        };
    </code>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Tuples</summary>

    Tuples operate similarly to a list, except once data has been entered into it, it cannot be changed. This gives us a more secure data structure and may help reduce or prevent errors. 

    <code>
        stacks = (
            "Python",
            "MEAN",
            "Java",
            "C#"
        )
    </code>
